# Getting Started

Worx is a framework for building APIs in Go with support for TMF (Telecom Management Forum) standards. Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Install Worx:

```bash
go get -u github.com/grahms/worx
```

### 2. Initialize Your Application:

Create a new Worx application:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/grahms/worx"
	"github.com/grahms/worx/router"
)

func main() {
	app := worx.NewApplication("/api", "Product Catalog API")
}
```

### 3. Define Your API Endpoint:

Create a new API endpoint using the `NewRouter` function:

```go
product := worx.NewRouter[Product, ProductResponse]("/products")
```

### 4. Include Routes in Your Application:

Include the defined route in your Worx application **before defining handlers**:

```go
worx.IncludeRoute(app, product)
```

### 5. Handle Requests:

Define your request handling logic using the `HandleCreate`, `HandleRead`, `HandleUpdate`, and `HandleList` methods:

```go
product.HandleCreate("", func(product Product, params *router.RequestParams) (*router.ProcessorError, *ProductResponse) {
	return nil, &ProductResponse{
		Product:  product,
		BaseType: nil,
		Url:      nil,
	}
})
```

### 6. Run Your Application:

Start your Worx application and listen on a specified port:

```go
err := app.Run(":8080")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

Now, your Worx application is ready to handle TMF API requests.

Make sure to include the route before defining the handlers to ensure that the routes are properly registered in your application. Happy coding
